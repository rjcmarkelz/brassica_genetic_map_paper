  abstract = {The recent advances in sequencing throughput and genome assembly algorithms have established whole-genome shotgun (WGS) assemblies as the cornerstone of the genomic infrastructure for many species. WGS assemblies can be constructed with comparative ease and give a comprehensive representation of the gene space even of large and complex genomes. One major obstacle in utilizing WGS assemblies for important research applications such as gene isolation or comparative genomics has been the lack of chromosomal positioning and contextualization of short sequence contigs. Assigning chromosomal locations to sequence contigs required the construction and integration of genome-wide physical maps and dense genetic linkage maps as well as synteny to model species. Recently, methods to rapidly construct ultra-dense linkage maps encompassing millions of genetic markers from WGS sequencing data of segregating populations have made possible the direct assignment of genetic positions to short sequence contigs. Here, we review recent developments in the integration of WGS assemblies and sequence-based linkage maps, discuss challenges for further improvement of the methodology and outline possible applications building on genetically anchored WGS assemblies.},

  abstract = {Author Summary   The initial publication of the genome sequence of many plants, animals, and microbes is often accompanied with great fanfare. However, these genomes are almost always first-drafts, with a lot of missing data, many gaps, and many errors in the published sequences. Compounding this problem, the genes identified in draft genome sequences are also affected by incomplete genome assemblies: the number and exact structure of predicted genes may be incorrect. Here we quantify the extent of such errors, by comparing several draft genomes against completed versions of the same sequences. Surprisingly, we find huge numbers of errors in the number of genes predicted from draft assemblies, with more than half of all genes having the wrong number of copies in the draft genomes examined. Our investigation also reveals the major causes of these errors, and further analyses using additional functional data demonstrate that many of the gene predictions can be corrected. The results presented here suggest that many inferences based on published draft genomes may be erroneous, but offer a way forward for future analyses.},

  abstract = {High-density linkage maps are important tools for genome biology and evolutionary genetics by quantifying the extent of recombination, linkage disequilibrium, and chromosomal rearrangements across chromosomes, sexes, and populations. They provide one of the best ways to validate and refine de novo genome assemblies, with the power to identify errors in assemblies increasing with marker density. However, assembly of high-density linkage maps is still challenging due to software limitations. We describe Lep-MAP2, a software for ultradense genome-wide linkage map construction. Lep-MAP2 can handle various family structures and can account for achiasmatic meiosis to gain linkage map accuracy. Simulations show that Lep-MAP2 outperforms other available mapping software both in computational efficiency and accuracy. When applied to two large F2-generation recombinant crosses between two nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations, it produced two high-density (\ensuremath{\sim}6 markers/cM) linkage maps containing 18,691 and 20,054 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The two maps showed a high degree of synteny, but female maps were 1.5\textendash{}2 times longer than male maps in all linkage groups, suggesting genome-wide recombination suppression in males. Comparison with the genome sequence of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) revealed a high degree of interspecific synteny with a low frequency (\ensuremath{<}5\%) of interchromosomal rearrangements. However, a fairly large (ca. 10 Mb) translocation from autosome to sex chromosome was detected in both maps. These results illustrate the utility and novel features of Lep-MAP2 in assembling high-density linkage maps, and their usefulness in revealing evolutionarily interesting properties of genomes, such as strong genome-wide sex bias in recombination rates.},

This algorithm serves as a basis to deduce an exact algorithm for general graphs using a tree decomposition of the input. We explore other structural parameters, proving a linear-size problem kernel with respect to the size of a feedback-edge set on a restricted version of Scaffolding. Finally, we examine some parameters of scaffold graphs, which are based on real-world genomes, revealing that the feedback edge set is significantly smaller than the input size.},

Here, we describe a simpler approach ("Chicago") based on in vitro reconstituted chromatin. We generated two Chicago datasets with human DNA and used a new software pipeline ("HiRise") to construct a highly accurate de novo assembly and scaffolding of a human genome with scaffold N50 of 30 Mb. We also demonstrated the utility of Chicago for improving existing assemblies by re-assembling and scaffolding the genome of the American alligator. With a single library and one lane of Illumina HiSeq sequencing, we increased the scaffold N50 of the American alligator from 508 kb to 10 Mb. Our method uses established molecular biology procedures and can be used to analyze any genome, as it requires only about 5 micrograms of DNA as the starting material.},

  abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

  abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and genotyping are essential to genetic mapping. There remains a need for a simple, inexpensive platform that allows high-density SNP discovery and genotyping in large populations. Here we describe the sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) tags, which identified more than 13,000 SNPs, and mapped three traits in two model organisms, using less than half the capacity of one Illumina sequencing run. We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in  F 2   individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by  in silico  re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in  Neurospora crassa . Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.},

In this study, deep transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of Brassica rapa was undertaken with two objectives: SNP detection and improved transcriptome annotation. We performed SNP detection on two varieties that are parents of a mapping population to aid in development of a marker system for this population and subsequent development of high-resolution genetic map. An improved Brassica rapa transcriptome was constructed to detect novel transcripts and to improve the current genome annotation. This is useful for accurate mRNA abundance and detection of expression QTL (eQTLs) in mapping populations. Deep RNA-Seq of two Brassica rapa genotypes\textemdash{}R500 (var. trilocularis, Yellow Sarson) and IMB211 (a rapid cycling variety)\textemdash{}using eight different tissues (root, internode, leaf, petiole, apical meristem, floral meristem, silique, and seedling) grown across three different environments (growth chamber, greenhouse and field) and under two different treatments (simulated sun and simulated shade) generated 2.3 billion high-quality Illumina reads. A total of 330,995 SNPs were identified in transcribed regions between the two genotypes with an average frequency of one SNP in every 200 bases. The deep RNA-Seq reassembled Brassica rapa transcriptome identified 44,239 protein-coding genes. Compared with current gene models of B. rapa, we detected 3537 novel transcripts, 23,754 gene models had structural modifications, and 3655 annotated proteins changed. Gaps in the current genome assembly of B. rapa are highlighted by our identification of 780 unmapped transcripts. All the SNPs, annotations, and predicted transcripts can be viewed at http://phytonetworks.ucdavis.edu/.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows\textendash{}Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is \ensuremath{\sim}10\textendash{}20\texttimes{} faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.

  doi = {10.1534/g3.112.002428},
  abstract = {Numerous mapping projects conducted on different species have generated an abundance of mapping data. Consequently, many multilocus maps have been constructed using diverse mapping populations and marker sets for the same organism. The quality of maps varies broadly among populations, marker sets, and software used, necessitating efforts to integrate the mapping information and generate consensus maps. The problem of consensus genetic mapping (MCGM) is by far more challenging compared with genetic mapping based on a single dataset, which by itself is also cumbersome. The additional complications introduced by consensus analysis include inter-population differences in recombination rate and exchange distribution along chromosomes; variations in dominance of the employed markers; and use of different subsets of markers in different labs. Hence, it is necessary to handle arbitrary patterns of shared sets of markers and different level of mapping data quality. In this article, we introduce a two-phase approach for solving MCGM. In phase 1, for each dataset, multilocus ordering is performed combined with iterative jackknife resampling to evaluate the stability of marker orders. In this phase, the ordering problem is reduced to the well-known traveling salesperson problem (TSP). Namely, for each dataset, we look for order that gives minimum sum of recombination distances between adjacent markers. In phase 2, the optimal consensus order of shared markers is selected from the set of allowed orders and gives the minimal sum of total lengths of nonconflicting maps of the chromosome. This criterion may be used in different modifications to take into account the variation in quality of the original data (population size, marker quality, etc.). In the foregoing formulation, consensus mapping is considered as a specific version of TSP that can be referred to as ``synchronized TSP.'' The conflicts detected after phase 1 are resolved using either a heuristic algorithm over the entire chromosome or an exact/heuristic algorithm applied subsequently to the revealed small non-overlapping regions with conflicts separated by non-conflicting regions. The proposed approach was tested on a wide range of simulated data and real datasets from maize.},

  abstract = {Background  Over the past decade many linkage studies have defined chromosomal intervals containing polymorphisms that modulate a variety of traits. Many phenotypes are now associated with enough mapping data that meta-analysis could help refine locations of known QTLs and detect many novel QTLs.    Methodology/Principal Findings  We describe a simple approach to combining QTL mapping results for multiple studies and demonstrate its utility using two hippocampus weight loci. Using data taken from two populations, a recombinant inbred strain set and an advanced intercross population we demonstrate considerable improvements in significance and resolution for both loci. 1-LOD support intervals were improved 51\% for  Hipp1a  and 37\% for  Hipp9a . We first generate locus-wise permuted P-values for association with the phenotype from multiple maps, which can be done using a permutation method appropriate to each population. These results are then assigned to defined physical positions by interpolation between markers with known physical and genetic positions. We then use Fisher's combination test to combine position-by-position probabilities among experiments. Finally, we calculate genome-wide combined P-values by generating locus-specific P-values for each permuted map for each experiment. These permuted maps are then sampled with replacement and combined. The distribution of best locus-specific P-values for each combined map is the null distribution of genome-wide adjusted P-values.    Conclusions/Significance  Our approach is applicable to a wide variety of segregating and non-segregating mapping populations, facilitates rapid refinement of physical QTL position, is complementary to other QTL fine mapping methods, and provides an appropriate genome-wide criterion of significance for combined mapping results.},

A linkage map of a hypothetical diploid and monoecious plant species was simulated containing one linkage group and 21 markers with fixed distance of 3 cM between them. In all, 700 F2 populations were randomly simulated with 100 and 400 individuals with different combinations of dominant and co-dominant markers, as well as 10 and 20\% of missing data. The simulations showed that, in the presence of co-dominant markers only, any combination of algorithm and criteria may be used, even for a reduced population size. In the case of a smaller proportion of dominant markers, any of the algorithms and criteria (except SALOD) investigated may be used. In the presence of high proportions of dominant markers and smaller samples (around 100), the probability of repulsion linkage increases between them and, in this case, use of the algorithms TRY and SER associated to RIPPLE with criterion LHMC would provide better results.},

These changes include divergence in protein-coding gene sequence, structure, and location, as well as divergence in noncoding DNAs. The most important unresolved issue is understanding the evolutionary causes of the divergence within species that in turn leads to incompatibility between species. Surprisingly, much of this divergence does not appear to be driven by ecological adaptation but may instead result from responses to purely mutational mechanisms or to internal genetic conflicts.},

The study was based upon three linkage groups of 10 loci at 2, 6, and 10 cM spacings simulated from a doubled-haploid population of size 150. Criteria performance were assessed using the number of replicates with correctly estimated orders, the mean rank correlation between the estimated and the true order and the mean total map length. Bootstrap samples from replicates in the maximum likelihood analysis produced a measure of confidence in the estimated locus order. The effects of missing values and/or typing errors in the data are to reduce the proportion of correctly ordered maps, and this problem worsens as the distances between loci decreases. The maximum likelihood criterion is most successful at ordering loci correctly, but gives estimated map lengths, which are substantially inflated when typing errors are present. The presence of missing values in the data produces shorter map lengths for more widely spaced markers, especially under the weighted least-squares criterion. Overall, the presence of segregation distortion has little effect on this population.},

The LPmerge software uses linear programming to efficiently minimize the mean absolute error between the consensus map and the linkage maps from each population. This minimization is performed subject to linear inequality constraints that ensure the ordering of the markers in the linkage maps is preserved. When marker order is inconsistent between linkage maps, a minimum set of ordinal constraints is deleted to resolve the conflicts.

  abstract = {Legumes are simultaneously one of the largest families of crop plants and a cornerstone in the biological nitrogen cycle. We combined molecular and phylogenetic analyses to evaluate genome conservation both within and between the two major clades of crop legumes. Genetic mapping of orthologous genes identifies broad conservation of genome macrostructure, especially within the galegoid legumes, while also highlighting inferred chromosomal rearrangements that may underlie the variation in chromosome number between these species. As a complement to comparative genetic mapping, we compared sequenced regions of the model legume Medicago truncatula with those of the diploid Lotus japonicus and the polyploid Glycine max. High conservation was observed between the genomes of M. truncatula and L. japonicus, whereas lower levels of conservation were evident between M. truncatula and G. max. In all cases, conserved genome microstructure was punctuated by significant structural divergence, including frequent insertion/deletion of individual genes or groups of genes and lineage-specific expansion/contraction of gene families. These results suggest that comparative mapping may have considerable utility for basic and applied research in the legumes, although its predictive value is likely to be tempered by phylogenetic distance and genome duplication.},

We show that, in crosses between strains of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, loci interact epistatically, controlling a recessive embryo lethality. This interaction is explained by divergent evolution occurring among paralogs of an essential duplicate gene, for which the functional copy is not located at the same locus in different accessions. These paralogs demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in their respective evolutionary trajectories, which results in widespread incompatibility among strains. Our data suggest that these passive mechanisms, gene duplication and extinction, could represent an important source of genetic incompatibilities across all taxa.

The basic principle of the mapping scheme is to develop, by recombinant DNA techniques, random single-copy DNA probes capable of detecting DNA sequence polymorphisms, when hybridized to restriction digests of an individual's DNA. Each of these probes will define a locus. Loci can be expanded or contracted to include more or less polymorphism by further application of recombinant DNA technology. Suitably polymorphic loci can be tested for linkage relationships in human pedigrees by established methods; and loci can be arranged into linkage groups to form a true genetic map of "DNA marker loci." Pedigrees in which inherited traits are known to be segregating can then be analyzed, making possible the mapping of the gene(s) responsible for the trait with respect to the DNA marker loci, without requiring direct access to a specified gene's DNA. For inherited diseases mapped in this way, linked DNA marker loci can be used predictively for genetic counseling.},

For genome-wide SNP discovery, 27 apple cultivars were chosen to represent worldwide breeding germplasm and re-sequenced at low coverage with the Illumina Genome Analyzer II. Following alignment of these sequences to the whole genome sequence of 'Golden Delicious', SNPs were identified using SoapSNP. A total of 2,113,120 SNPs were detected, corresponding to one SNP to every 288 bp of the genome. The Illumina GoldenGate\textregistered{} assay was then used to validate a subset of 144 SNPs with a range of characteristics, using a set of 160 apple accessions. This validation assay enabled fine-tuning of the final subset of SNPs for the Illumina Infinium\textregistered{} II system. The set of stringent filtering criteria developed allowed choice of a set of SNPs that not only exhibited an even distribution across the apple genome and a range of minor allele frequencies to ensure utility across germplasm, but also were located in putative exonic regions to maximize genotyping success rate. A total of 7867 apple SNPs was established for the IRSC apple 8K SNP array v1, of which 5554 were polymorphic after evaluation in segregating families and a germplasm collection. This publicly available genomics resource will provide an unprecedented resolution of SNP haplotypes, which will enable marker-locus-trait association discovery, description of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, investigation of genetic variation (neutral and functional), and genomic selection in apple.},

Some of these mutations may improve the ability of an individual to survive and reproduce\textemdash{}known as fitness\textemdash{}and are likely to become more common in the population. Other mutations may reduce an individual's fitness and are likely to be lost. However, it is believed that most of the mutations will have no effect on the fitness of individuals. It is not known why many of these `neutral' genetic differences are maintained in populations. Some researchers have proposed that they are kept by chance and that there is no direct advantage to the population of keeping them unless these neutral mutations later become beneficial. However, other researchers think that the genetic variation itself may improve the fitness of the population by allowing it to quickly adapt to changes in the environment. Arabidopsis thaliana is a small plant that lives in many different environments and has high levels of genetic variation in many of its physical traits. One of these traits is the production of molecules called glucosinolates, which help the plants to defend against herbivores and infection by microbes. Previous studies have suggested that variation in the genes that make glucosinolates may improve the fitness of A. thaliana populations. To test this idea, Kerwin et al. carried out a field trial using A. thaliana plants that were genetically identical except for some of the genes involved in the production of glucosinolates. Kerwin et al. grew the plants in several different environments over several years. The field trial shows that variation in these genes affected the fitness of the plants in each of the different environments. However, the fitness benefit depended on the environment, and no single gene variant provided the best fitness across all environments, or over all the years of the trial. Kerwin et al.'s findings suggest that changes in the environment may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in the genes that make glucosinolates. This raises the questions of how many other genes in plants (or other species such as humans) have genetic variation that contributes to fitness across varied environments; and how can this link be tested in natural settings.},

Although it is feasible to construct de novo genome assemblies in a few months, there has been relatively little attention to what is lost by sole application of short sequence reads. We compared the recent de novo assemblies using the short oligonucleotide analysis package (SOAP), generated from the genomes of a Han Chinese individual and a Yoruban individual, to experimentally validated genomic features. We found that de novo assemblies were 16.2\% shorter than the reference genome and that 420.2 megabase pairs of common repeats and 99.1\% of validated duplicated sequences were missing from the genome. Consequently, over 2,377 coding exons were completely missing. We conclude that high-quality sequencing approaches must be considered in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing for comparative genomics analyses and studies of genome evolution.},

Electrophoresis-based techniques made it possible to map 50 expressed sequence tag polymorphisms (ESTPs). The map positions of 32 markers were compared to putative orthologous loci on the loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) linkage map, which is the reference map of the conifer genetic mapping community. Overall, synteny was maintained between the two species. This report agrees with other pairwise genome comparisons in pine and supports the cytogenetic evidence that chromosome evolution in the genus is conservative. The alignment of homologous linkage groups allowed, for the first time in conifers, the comparison of QTL location. The position of two QTLs controlling wood density and cell wall components were found to be conserved between the two species.},

  abstract = {Bar-coded multiplexed sequencing approaches based on new-generation sequencing technologies provide capacity to sequence a mapping population in a single sequencing run. However, such approaches usually generate low-coverage and error-prone sequences for each line in a population. Thus, it is a significant challenge to genotype individual lines in a population for linkage map construction based on low-coverage sequences without the availability of high-quality genotype data of the parental lines. In this paper, we report a method for constructing ultrahigh-density linkage maps composed of high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on low-coverage sequences of recombinant inbred lines. First, all potential SNPs were identified to obtain drafts of parental genotypes using a maximum parsimonious inference of recombination, making maximum use of SNP information found in the entire population. Second, high-quality SNPs were identified by filtering out low-quality ones by permutations involving resampling of windows of SNPs followed by Bayesian inference. Third, lines in the mapping population were genotyped using the high-quality SNPs assisted by a hidden Markov model. With 0.05\texttimes{} genome sequence per line, an ultrahigh-density linkage map composed of bins of high-quality SNPs using 238 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two rice varieties was constructed. Using this map, a quantitative trait locus for grain width (GW5) was localized to its presumed genomic region in a bin of 200 kb, confirming the accuracy and quality of the map. This method is generally applicable in genetic map construction with low-coverage sequence data.},

  abstract = {Current de novo whole-genome sequencing approaches often are inadequate for organisms lacking substantial preexisting genetic data. Problems with these methods are manifest as: large numbers of scaffolds that are not ordered within chromosomes or assigned to individual chromosomes, misassembly of allelic sequences as separate loci when the individual(s) being sequenced are heterozygous, and the collapse of recently duplicated sequences into a single locus, regardless of levels of heterozygosity. Here we propose a new approach for producing de novo whole-genome sequences\textemdash{}which we call recombinant population genome construction\textemdash{}that solves many of the problems encountered in standard genome assembly and that can be applied in model and nonmodel organisms. Our approach takes advantage of next-generation sequencing technologies to simultaneously barcode and sequence a large number of individuals from a recombinant population. The sequences of all recombinants can be combined to create an initial de novo assembly, followed by the use of individual recombinant genotypes to correct assembly splitting/collapsing and to order and orient scaffolds within linkage groups. Recombinant population genome construction can rapidly accelerate the transformation of nonmodel species into genome-enabled systems by simultaneously producing a high-quality genome assembly and providing genomic tools (e.g., high-confidence single-nucleotide polymorphisms) for immediate applications. In populations segregating for important functional traits, this approach also enables simultaneous mapping of quantitative trait loci. We demonstrate our method using simulated Illumina data from a recombinant population of Caenorhabditis elegans and show that the method can produce a high-fidelity, high-quality genome assembly for both parents of the cross.},

However, these genomes are almost always first-drafts, with a lot of missing data, many gaps, and many errors in the published sequences. Compounding this problem, the genes identified in draft genome sequences are also affected by incomplete genome assemblies: the number and exact structure of predicted genes may be incorrect. Here we quantify the extent of such errors, by comparing several draft genomes against completed versions of the same sequences. Surprisingly, we find huge numbers of errors in the number of genes predicted from draft assemblies, with more than half of all genes having the wrong number of copies in the draft genomes examined. Our investigation also reveals the major causes of these errors, and further analyses using additional functional data demonstrate that many of the gene predictions can be corrected. The results presented here suggest that many inferences based on published draft genomes may be erroneous, but offer a way forward for future analyses.},

Collinearity between the map and the genome-wide reference sequence for watermelon was studied to identify inconsistency and chromosome rearrangements. We assessed genome-wide nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and selective sweep for wild, semi-wild, and domesticated accessions of Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus to track signals of domestication. Principal component analysis combined with chromosome-wide phylogenetic study based on 1563 SNPs obtained after LD pruning with minor allele frequency of 0.05 resolved the differences between semi-wild and wild accessions as well as relationships among worldwide sweet watermelon. Population structure analysis revealed predominant ancestries for wild, semi-wild, and domesticated watermelons as well as admixture of various ancestries that were important for domestication. Sliding window analysis of Tajima's D across various chromosomes was used to resolve selective sweep. LD decay was estimated for various chromosomes. We identified a strong selective sweep on chromosome 3 consisting of important genes that might have had a role in sweet watermelon domestication.},
