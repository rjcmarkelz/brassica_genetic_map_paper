A general problem in biology is creating causal links between changes in the DNA sequence (genotype) and measurable characteristics of an organism (phenotype). Spanning the genotype to phenotype gap has implications for understanding human and animal diseases as well as understanding drivers of plant growth and yield in agriculture. Genetic mapping populations have been created as tools to aid in linking genotype to phenotype through statistical techniques. With recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies more genotypic information can be collected on individuals in mapping populations to aid in the search of causal genes for complex phenotypic traits important for agriculture such as plant flowering time. One such population is the Bra-Irri population that was created from a cross between a rapid cycling line and a common oilseed variety of Brassica rapa (@iniguez-luy_development_2009).
The previous genetic resources available for this population includes 224 SSR markers spread across 10 linkage groups (chromosomes). While this has been an extremely great resource for mapping a diverse set of phenotypic traits (@lou_genetic_2011, @dechaine_qtl_2014, @brock_floral_2010), the existing markers were not anchored to a known location in the genome. The Brassica rapa genome was released in 2012...
